/**
 * The CPU embedder, for browsers that can't run WebGPU.
 *
 * web-llm hard-requires `maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage >= 10` and throws
 * below it. Firefox reports 9, Safari has no WebGPU on most versions, and
 * most mobile browsers have none either. Those users could still chat through
 * a local server, but they got no retrieval at all — the moment their plan
 * outgrew the context budget it was silently trimmed, which is the exact
 * failure RAG exists to prevent.
 *
 * Same weights as the WebGPU path, run by onnxruntime instead of TVM, so the
 * vectors land in the same space and carry the same `EMBEDDING_MODEL` tag.
 * The fp32 build is deliberate: a quantized one is a quarter of the download
 * but its vectors drift away from the WebGPU path's, and two subtly different
 * spaces scored against each other is a bug nobody would ever see, because
 * both are 384 dimensions and the dimension check would pass.
 *
 * Everything here is browser-only and behind a dynamic import, so
 * `@huggingface/transformers` never reaches the server bundle — the concern
 * that ruled it out in §4.1.
